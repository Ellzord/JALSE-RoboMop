## RoboMop
RoboMop is a [JALSE](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE) example project. The mop cleans the floor tile it is current on and then moves in a consistent direction until it meets an edge. Once the mop has met an edge it will randomly change direction. This will repeat until the floor is eventually clean.
